The phrase **'hello world'** has a special significance to everyone in computer science field. It is usually  this iconic line of text that introduces one to the intriguing field of programming. It's kind of equivalent to saying '**hello**' to the new programming language or to a new journey that you embark upon. I am creating this first post as a '**hello world**' post before I enter the world of GitHub pages, GitHub actions, jekyll themes, liquid and so forth.

```javascript
console.log('hello world!');
```
